// nudgeEventRetryEpsilon pads each delayed retry an attempt may schedule, so

// earn: the event can beat the activity tracker's STAMP of that transition (the
// tracker stamps at its next debounced poll), so the first retry — scheduled
// against a still-working observation — may land just inside the re-stamped
// window (live-verified against herdr 0.7.3); the remaining window shrinks
// every round for a settled-idle agent, so the chain converges, while a busy
// agent burns the whole budget on cheap rejects and the kick dies until its
// next idle event.
//
// The budget belongs to the event, which is what makes that bound real. A full
// backstop sweep (patrol tick, resync) carries no idle event and so grants no
// retries; handing every sweep a fresh budget would refill a permanently busy
// session's chain on every patrol interval, forever.

// nudgeEventDispatcher delivers queued nudges on the provider's push session
// events: an agent_status→idle event for a session with pending queue items
// earns a targeted delivery attempt, and stream resyncs / wake-socket pings /
// patrol fallbacks earn a full pass. Delivery itself is the canonical queued
// path (tryDeliverQueuedNudgesByPoller: claim, fence, blocked-withdrawal,
// provider Nudge, ack) — this component only decides WHEN to attempt it.
//
// Idle events are level-triggered replayed hints (see runtime.SessionEvent):
// an attempt never trusts the event, it re-reads the queue and the live
// observation. The activity tracker stamps LastActivity at the very idle
// transition the event reports (possibly a poll-debounce beat later), so a
// just-idled agent fails the quiescence gate on the first attempts; each
// fresh-stamp reject schedules a retry for when the observed stamp will have
// aged past quiescence, within a small fixed budget. A settled-idle agent's
// remaining window shrinks every round until delivery; a busy agent
// (continuously fresh activity) burns the budget on cheap rejects and the
// kick dies — bounded work per event, never a poller loop. The provider's
// closed-loop delivery verifies paste+submit; it is the backstop, not the
// gate.
//
// A delivery blocks for seconds (idle verification, paste, submit confirm)
// and cannot be canceled: runtime.Provider.Nudge takes no context, and the
// herdr client applies no default timeout, so a wedged pane holds its caller
// until herdr itself returns. The scheduler goroutine therefore never runs a
// delivery itself. It hands each due session to a goroutine of that session's
// own, at most one in flight per session, which is exactly the blast radius
// the per-session sidecar pollers had: one wedged pane strands its own
// session's queue and no other. Coalescing on the in-flight set also keeps the
// goroutine count bounded by the number of sessions with queued work, rather
// than by the number of events that arrived while one was stuck.
//
// The backstop sweep does not deliver. It walks the sessions with pending
// items and hands each to a pass of its own, so a pane wedged inside Nudge
// stalls only its own session and the sweep still reaches the rest. That
// matters most for a session that is ALREADY idle when its nudge is queued:
// it emits no new idle event, so the sweep is its only path, and an inline
// sweep stranded it behind whichever pane happened to hang first.
//
// Providers without an event stream (tmux) leave the dispatcher inactive and
// every existing path byte-identical: the supervisor tick keeps its inline
// pass, and legacy mode keeps its sidecar pollers.

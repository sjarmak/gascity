//
// Wake dedup collapses several beads for one template into a single wake
// request, but it kept whichever bead it saw FIRST and dropped the rest. Dedup
// runs before the canonical sort, so a P0 arriving behind a P2 was discarded and
// the template competed for scarce capacity as a P2 — losing a shared cap to a
// P1 template that should have ranked behind it. The surviving request must be
// the one the pool's policy ranks best, not the first one enumerated.

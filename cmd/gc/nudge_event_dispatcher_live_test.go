// TestNudgeEventDispatcherLiveHerdr drives the dispatcher against a real herdr
// binary: the provider's own event stream, herdr's own agent registry, and a
// real status report are what wake it, not a fake. What it asserts is the chain
// this change adds — an idle status report for a registered pane arrives as an
// attributed event and becomes a delivery pass for THAT session, while the
// sidecar poller class stays retired (its directory empty).
//
// It deliberately stops short of asserting the text reaches the pane, because a
// fixture cannot get there on herdr 0.8.0. The pane runs a bare shell, so the
// agent herdr has registered for it is never an "active named agent": `agent
// prompt` is refused with agent_not_ready, and the paste fallback is refused in
// turn, on purpose, because a registered pane may have an agent mid-turn
// (client.go targetHasNoNamedAgent). Only a real agent TUI completes delivery,
// which is the live work cycle's job rather than a unit fixture's. The
// dispatcher's own delivery mechanics are covered against a fake, where the
// closed loop can be driven end to end.
